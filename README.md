# ðŸš€ Kickstarter Projects Dashboard ðŸ“Š

Welcome to my **Kickstarter Projects Dashboard**! This project analyzes crowdfunding data to give valuable insights into how Kickstarter projects perform. Below are the main highlights:

## Key Metrics:
- **# Projects**: Total number of Kickstarter projects.
- **# Backers**: Number of people who supported the ideas.
- **Total Pledged**: Total amount raised by all projects.
- **# Successful Projects**: Number of projects that reached their funding goal.

## Visuals:
- **Total Pledged by Country**: A column chart showing the countries with the highest contributions.
- **Projects by Category**: A tree map illustrating which categories rank the highest in terms of success.

### Tools Used:
- **Power BI**: For data modeling and visualization.
- **SQL**: To query the data for analysis.
- **Excel**: To organize and clean the data.

Feel free to explore the dashboard and the code behind it! Feedback and suggestions are welcome.
